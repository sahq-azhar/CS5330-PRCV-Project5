#### README:-


OS - Windows 11<br>
IDE - VS Code<br>
report - uploaded to github <br>



#### INSTRUCTIONS:<br>
#### Task-1
execute task1_train.py to fetch the MNIST dataset and store it in the designated folder. Then, train the model using the dataset and save the resulting outputs in the same folder.

#### Task-2
execute task2_analyze.py to perform an examination and analysis of the filter's effects, and display the results.

#### Task-3
execute task3_greek.py to generate CSV files, print out the SSD (sum of squared differences) result, and make predictions on the new input data in the test_greek folder.

#### Task-4
execute task4_fashion_train.py to conduct experiments with a deep network for the MNIST task, and evaluate the effects of modifying various aspects of the network.

#### Extensions
execute the realtime_detection.py file located in the extension folder to perform real-time text recognition.
